# React Tic-Tac-Toe

## About

This was built following [this tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) from React's docs.

This is an interactive tic-tac-toe game. In addition to the primary game functionality, the user can also show past moves.

All five challenges from the end of the tutorial have also been implemented:

> 1. For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
> 2. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
> 3. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
> 4. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
> 5. Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
